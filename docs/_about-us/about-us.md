### Violet and Oberon, Canadian team of print and surface pattern designers. 

With a passion for everything literary we love creating beautiful designs inspired by the greatest works of literature and their authors. Long-time Sherlockians, we strive at adapting and redesigning some of the early illustrations of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sidney Paget, Frederic Dorr Steele, and Charles Dana Gibson and making them available on gorgeous gifts available on [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/VioletAndOberon/shop).

We warmly welcome commissions.

If you are intested in one of our designs but would like to see it in a different colour, please let us know.
