VioletAndOberon digital artists, print, and surface pattern designers with a passion for everything literary.
We love creating beautiful
designs inspired by the greatest works of literature and their
authors. Long-time Sherlockians, we strive at adapting and redesigning
some of the early illustrations of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
by Sidney Paget, Frederic Dorr Steele, and Charles Dana Gibson and
making them available on gorgeous gifts available on
[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/VioletAndOberon/shop).

If you are intested in one of our designs but would like to see it in
a different colour, please let us know.

We warmly welcome commissions.
