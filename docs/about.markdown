**VioletAndOberon originated as a Redbubble graphic art gift shop.** 


We love creating beautiful designs inspired by the greatest works of literature and their
authors. Long-time Sherlockians, we strive at adapting and redesigning
some of the early illustrations of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
by Sidney Paget, Frederic Dorr Steele, and Charles Dana Gibson and
making them available on gorgeous gifts available on
[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/VioletAndOberon/shop).


We also have a profound love and reverence for the music of composer Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges. We have a whole [collection](https://www.redbubble.com/people/violetandoberon/shop?artistUserName=VioletAndOberon&collections=2396303&iaCode=all-departments&sortOrder=relevant) of designs dedicated to him.
