This year, I have decided to celebrate Halloween the Sherlockian way. I have even coined a name for it, even though I concede that others might have thought of the word play way before me. I have named this October spooky season "Holmes-O-Ween". Here are a few ideas of how to celebrate this time of the year when you are a Sherlock Holmes fan.

# 1 Dress like a Sherlockian with a Halloween twist

I have created a gorgeous artwork with a jack-o'-lantern carved with the famous Sidney Paget profile of Sherlock Holmes. Please make sure to look at it at my [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Happy-Holmes-O-Ween-by-VioletAndOberon/126635061.IJ6L0.XYZ) and [TeePublic](https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/35483277-happy-holmes-o-ween?store_id=1868119) shops.

# 2 Read the scariest adventures of Sherlock Holmes

I have asked other Sherlockians to help me round up the scariest adventures of Sherlock Holmes that would be perfect to read during the Halloween Holmes-O-Ween season. Click on the titles to read the stories online on Wikipedia or Gutenberg.

# 3 Organize Victorian spooky parlour games and "tea"

Unless you are scared by the supernatural, you could organize of spooky games like the ones favored by the people of the Victorian era such as Seances (make a circle of salt and keep a Saint Benedict medal to protect you just in case), [Ouija boards](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-strange-and-mysterious-history-of-the-ouija-board-5860627/), and telling ghost stories. 

[Here](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/subject/2716) you will find ghost stories books on Gutenberg.


There are other victorian traditions that you might want to try out such as eating [Barmbrack cake](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Barmbrack) to tell your fortune, [bobbing for apples](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apple_bobbing), or even [oomancy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Oomancy).

Keep all your guests slightly on edge with cups of warm coffee or tea, and well-fed by serving sandwiches and mixed fruits and nuts in a pumpkin-shaped dish.

# 4 Carve up turnips

Yes, you could carve up pumpkins, but to make it more unusual, Victorian and Sherlockian, you could carve up turnips. Bonus points if you try to reproduce some key scenes and characters of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.


# 5 Host a Murder Mystery Party

If you are not an introvert like I am and fancy a Cluedo night, you may wish to host your own Murder mystery party. You could purchase a kit or create your own characters and plots. If you take inspiration from one of the cases solved by Sherlock Holmes, make sure that your guests are not expert in the canon themselves!
