You have to choose a surprise gift for a fan of Sherlock Holmes but you have no idea what to pick? We got you. Here are the best gift ideas that will delight Sherlockians and Holmesians alike.

# 1 The mug of The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

Featuring the cover of *The Hound of the Baskervilles* by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle this bright red mug will turn every cup of tea or coffee into a true moment of Sherlockian indulgence.

#### Sherlockian reason for choosing this gift

This image is absolutely iconic for all fans of Sherlock Holmes. The illustrator, Sidney Paget, is the artist who created the look of Sherlock Holmes as imagined by generations of readers of the Adventures of the world's greatest detective. 

The first edition of *The Hound of the Baskervilles* published by George Newnes Ltd in 1902, with its strikingly dramatic touches of red, gold, and black is one of the most coveted treasures for collectors.

#### Practical reason

Everybody needs a mug. It is a budget-friendly gift. It will always be used and remind the recipient of your kind gesture. The gold is simulated, it is ink, not a metallic foil. This means your mug can be filled with a kettle but it can also be put safely in the microwave.

# 2 The best T-shirt for people who love dogs and Sherlock Holmes

If your fan of Sherlock Holmes also adores dogs, we found the most amazing gift: the 221B Barker Street graphic T-shirt. The illustration showing two cute dogs dressed as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson will make everybody's heart melt.

#### Sherlockian reason for choosing this gift

These dogs make one of the most adorable representations of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. 

**You can hardly make more cute and dapper** than this cute pudgy pug wearing a bowler hat and tall slender curly Sherlock wearing a deerstalker hat.

The sign hanging above them is also based on a cute word play: Barker street instead of Baker street. 

#### Practical reason

Graphic T-shirts are printed with sublimation transfer technique: the illustration cannot peel away, it is literally inside the fibre (as we understand it). It is a gift that will last.

# 3 Sherlock Holmes birthday celebration sweatshirt

Do you know when Sherlock Holmes was born? Fans of Sherlock Holmes consider that he was born on January 6, 1854. While many fans would go as far as wearing an Inverness coat and deerstalker hat, all will be proud to wear this cozy and elegant pullover sweatshirt featuring the most famous profile illustration of Sherlock Holmes along with his date of birth in a fancy commemorative banner.

#### Sherlockian reason for choosing this gift

If there is one day of the year when Sherlock Holmes fans can show off their appreciation of the world's greatest detective, it is January 6, and what best than a beautiful warm pullover sweatshirt to express their belonging to the Sherlockian fandom? 

#### Practical reason

This gorgeous pullover sweatshirt is ethically sourced following the World Responsible Apparel Practices Standards. 
One very pratical consideration, if you live in the Northern Hemisphere your Sherlockian will definitely prefer wearing a sweatshirt to a T-shirt. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, feel free to pick some light top instead.

#### Practical reason

This Sherlock Holmes styled notebook has 120 pages and a document pocket in the back cover. It is a nice and useful gift, particularly for students and people who take a lot of notes.

# 5 When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth
### The best Sherlock Holmes quote on a T-shirt

This T-shirt is so beautiful. Not only does it feel Sherlockian, but it also has a strong elegant steampunk Victorian flair to it. Just looking at it, I feel like I am at 221B Baker Street, having a cup of tea with Mrs Hudson while waiting for my appointment to consult Sherlock Holmes. 

![When you have eliminated T-shirt](/images/when-you-have-eliminated-t-shirt.jpg)

#### Sherlockian reason for choosing this gift

"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth" was stated by Sherlock Holmes in *The Sign of the Four* (1890) by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is the quintessential Sherlockian quote because it clearly formulates the deduction technique used by the detective in all his adventures.

#### Practical reason

The T-shirt is beautiful and can easily be worn during relaxed or casual chic situations.

### How to choose the style and size

For 4 or 5 XL, choose the classic T-shirt, [here](https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/When-you-have-eliminated-the-impossible-whatever-remains-however-improbable-must-be-the-truth-beige-by-VioletAndOberon/93348292.IJ6L0).

# Bonus

We couldn't finish this review of the best gifts for fans of Sherlock Holmes without mentioning a gift that is definitely more for fans of Dr. Watson. 

### The adorable Watsonian good boy

This illustration is so cute. It shows a French Bulldog wearing a bowler hat along with the sentence I am lost without my bull pup. 

![Watson dog bullpup pillow](/images/watson-bullpup-pillow.jpg)

#### Watsonian reason for choosing this gift

Fans of Sherlock Holmes know of the dog owned by Dr Watson. In *A Study in Scarlet* Watson tells Holmes that he keeps a "Bull pup". While some fans think he might be referring to a gun, others are convinced that it is a dog.

#### Practical reason

This pillow is a sweet artistic addition to anybody's couch. Find it [here](https://www.redbubble.com/i/throw-pillow/French-Bulldog-wearing-a-bowler-hat-I-am-lost-without-my-bull-pup-by-VioletAndOberon/116046725.5X2YF).

*The adorable bulldog is also available on t-shirts, notebooks and other gifts.*


I hope this short list of gift ideas will help you find the best memorable and appreciated gift for your fan of Sherlock Holmes.
