Sherlock Holmes, what is the image that forms in your mind's eye when you think of the world's greatest consulting detective?


Television and films have featured so many versions brought to life with wildly varying success and acceptance by the public of the day. But what is the original source for all of these interpretations and images of Sherlock Holmes? For this, we must look back to 1891 and The Strand magazine.


Arthur Conan Doyle described his most famous creation as a tall thin man, over 6 feet, appearing taller due to his extreme leanness. He had heavy tufted brows and a thin hawk-like nose, with eyes rather close together on his thin face. Not a handsome man by any stretch of the imagination! And yet, when his stories first began appearing in The Strand magazine this is not the image we see.


Sidney Paget (1860-1908) a product of the Royal Academy Schools, was hired by the magazine to create illustrations to accompany the adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1891. Over the next 14 years, he produced 356 drawings for 37 of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes short stories and one novel. It was Paget that gave Holmes his popular image, a depiction somewhat at odds with Doyle's. Gone were the tufted brows and beady eyes, the nose now more aquiline than hawk-like, for Paget, according to legend chose his handsome younger brother Walter to serve as his model and become the *face* of Sherlock Holmes for generations to follow. 


At [Violet And Oberon](https://www.redbubble.com/people/VioletAndOberon/shop) we pride ourselves on giving these wonderful original illustrations new life in our designs available on Redbubble, honouring the impact they've made on the Sherlockian world. We feel they deserve to be lovingly colourized and displayed in a new format, to be proudly shown off by fans and collectors of Sherlock Holmes around the world. 


Most of our designs feature an original illustration from one of the canonical stories, with a background pattern linked to the story itself. 


Some also feature adaptations of original published illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele or Charles Dana Gibson, who also provided drawings for the classic tales in original publications.


We hope you will appreciate the detailed designs that we have created and share in our love of all things Sherlockian.
