# *Are you finding it challenging to find specific things in our store? We got you covered.*

Even though we try to upload most of our designs in collections, a lot of them don't actually appear on the screen.

First, I want to state this firmly, *I totally appreciate that it can get rather confusing and frustrating* to find things there. It was the same for me. Not that I consider myself illiterate in matters of world wide web, but I was born in a time when scouring microfiches and physical books was the norm. Finding things online does have a learning curve. It is absolutely fine to experiment and take the time to become comfortable with the whole process.

I am going to try to search for laptop skins. Maybe the phrase is not familiar to you. They are beautiful shiny very large stickers that people use to customize their laptops. They basically completely change the appearance of your laptop, like so.

They are really gorgeous and a great way to add a bit of flair to any laptop.


### The case of the Golden Pince-Nez laptop skins

Let's take the example of our Sherlockian Golden Pince-Nez laptop skins and let's imagine you are on your **desktop**. 


#### Finding the collection


The first step is to navigate to the collection. Most of our Sherlockian products are organized per stories. 

![Finding the collection](/images/img-find-the-collection.png)

We can see the collection dedicated to The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez on the right of the collection list. 

Upon clicking, the collection will open. I have tried scrolling, and there does not seem to be any laptop skin available. But there are, **they are just somewhat hidden behind other designs default views**.

See how it states 32 products at the top? I can assure you that there are more than 32 products.

When designers upload on Redbubble, they can choose to *use the same file across different products* and to zoom or change the alignment directly with a special Redbubble upload tool. This allows for faster creation of products. Designers can for instance use duvet cover files to create A-line dresses or floor pillows. Then, they choose a default view, such as duvet cover, which stands *"in front" of other products*. 

#### Using the filter menu

The best way to find specific products is to use **filters**.

By navigating to the Golden Pince-Nez collection we have already created a first filter. We only see products belonging to this collection. 

Searching for laptop skins is done through using another filter. If you look at the left of the screen, you can see a vertical list. You just need to find the right category. 

First navigate to the **accessories**.

Once you are in the accessories, still in the menu on the left of your screen, find the filter **tech acccessories**. It is towards the bottom, between socks and tote bags. 

After clicking, you will see a laptop skin, and some iPhone wallets. But it is not the end of the adventure yet.

There is not just one laptop skin. And if we click on the laptop skin filter...

![Three laptop skins](/images/img-three-laptop-skins.png)

**Yes, three laptop skins**. Give yourself a little pat on the back. It was not the easiest type of product to find for a beginner.


#### Beyond collections

Some of our products were not added to collections. It can be either that they didn't belong, or that the collection had reached its limit. In a few months, it may simply be that we will have reached the maximum amount of collections that can be created. 

Then, we would like to encourage you to not start with clicking on a collection, but to use products filter directly. We find it is the most straightforward way to find products from a desktop. 

We hope that this blog post was informative and helped you to become more comfortable with the use of filters to find products on Redbubble and particularly when visiting our [Violet And Oberon shop.](https://www.redbubble.com/people/VioletAndOberon/shop)
