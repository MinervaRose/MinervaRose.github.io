We are very excited to start our official VioletAndOberon blog.

We hope that you will enjoy our posts dedicated to our work and how we try to pay hommage to not only the amazing writers but also the talented illustrators and painters who enhanced books and magazines with gorgeous scenes and portraits.

While we mostly feature Sherlock Holmes art and designs, we also hold close to our hearts characters and works of other writers and composers. 

We hope that our designs will help share some of the brilliance of these amazing artists.
