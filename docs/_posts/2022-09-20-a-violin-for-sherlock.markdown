If you follow VioletAndOberon on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/violetandoberon/), you know that our own Violet is quite the crochet addict who shares some of her WIP at [HooksAndFrogs](https://www.instagram.com/hooksandfrogs/).

She has recently completed the cute Sherlock amigurumi created by [Vilonal on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/crocheted-consulting-detective).
She has done some minor changes to the original pattern that are detailed in this other post. 

Looking at this adorable crocheted Benedict Cumberbatch - I mean, his hair, look at his fluffy soft hair! - we thought there was something missing. 

What makes Sherlock Holmes apart from a deerstalker hat, magnifying glass, and a pipe?

His violin.

So Violet took up the challenge of creating a teeny tiny crocheted violin for little Sherlock. 

# Pattern and explanations

In this pattern, Violet tried to create as many parts of the violin as possible.

## Top and back plates 

Make two.

With beige yarn.

Ch12.

R1 sc10, sc3 in the last chain stitch. (Do not turn) Continue working around chain. sc9, sc2 in the last chain stitch.

R2 ch1. (Do not turn) Continue working around chain. dc in the stitch where you did your previous 9th sc. hdc3 in the next stitch. sc in next 2 stitches. ss in next 2 stitches. hdc in next 2 stitches. dc in next 3 stitches. hdc3 in next stitch. sc in next stitch. hdc3 in next stitch. dc in next 3 stitches. hdc in next 2 stitches. ss in next 2 stitches. sc in next 2 stitches. dhc3 in next stitch. ss in next stitch. Fasten off. Weave in ends.

Once you have made the top and back plates, place a small piece of cardboard or a bit of stuffing between them. Then sew them together with yarn of the same color.

Then we create the scroll.

With beige yarn.

Ch2. sc 4 in first chain stitch. Fasten off - leave a long tail.

Fold your black yarn rectangle into half. Place the scroll on one end. Use the tail to sew the rectangle like a tube.

## F-holes

Simply cut some piece of felt of black paper and glue them on. If you have some embroidery skills, feel free to embroider the f-holes, it will probably be prettier.

## Strings

With light grey of white sewing or embroidery thread.

Start from the neck, sew through the bridge, reach the tailpiece. Repeat 4 times.

## Bow

![bow](/images/IMG-4286.JPG)

Use a thin piece of metallic jewelry wire, or any material you find suitable. Make it bow shaped.

With beige yarn.

Crochet around the bow stick.

With black yarn.

Create a the frog of the bow by sewing a piece of black yarn at one end. 

Optional.

If your wire was already grey of white, you may wish to leave it as it is, with the bare wire standing for the hair. If not, feel free to cut the wire and replace it with a thread of white yarn.

## Optional details

If you are even more perfectionist than our Violet, you cut add more details to your violin, using beads, paper, felt, embroidery thread. The only limit is your imagination.

This is so adorable. The tiny violin and bow proportions go really well with little Sherlock.
