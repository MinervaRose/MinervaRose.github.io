I love offering gifts. That's it. I said it. I don't mind how long I have to research, triangulate my information, gently investigate without spoiling the surprise, scouring the Internet fail I can drive myself to shops. But I do appreciate that many people don't have the time, resources, and patience to do the same.

It can be a particularly daunting task when you need a gift for someone who is a scholar such as fans of the canon of Sherlock Holmes i.e. people who specifically love the 56 short stories and four novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle above any other subsequent works and adaptations.

Indeed, if they have read all the books, if they own all the books, what is there left to gift?

Faced with the same problem myself, and resolute not to make it final, I questioned Sherlockians about what made the canon so special. All mentioned the wonderful art of Sidney Paget that was created to accompany Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories in The Strand Magazine. 

Sidney Paget's illustrations were printed in black. Not very festive. So I found the 5 best gifts for the fans of the canon of Sherlock Holmes and Sidney Paget , modernized, with bright colors and high definition illustrations.

# 1 Wall art of The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

All fans of the Sherlock Holmes canon love the book cover of the first edition of The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The dark figure of the legendary Hound stands majestically on the moors. The art created by Sidney Paget is extremely powerful and elicits a profound feeling akin to fearful reverence.

A mounted print of Sidney Paget's Hound would be a great gift by adorning any Sherlockian corner, whether in a book nook, on top of an altar with cherished collectibles, or proudly hanged in a living room.

# 2 Mug with the portrait of Sherlock Holmes consulting detective by Sidney Paget

For fans of the Sherlock Holmes canon, the true face of Sherlock Holmes is not the one described by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle but the one imagined by Sidney Paget for The Strand Magazine. While the genius illustrator has drawn the detective within scenes matching key moments of the various cases investigated, he has also created a gorgeous portrait.

This beautiful mug of Sherlock Holmes consulting detective shows a modernized version of Sidney Paget's art with the elegant sobriety of black and white. It is the one mug that would easily find its place in a whisky cabinet.

# 3 Pencil case of the Hound of the Baskervilles glowing in the night

If The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of the most known adventures of Sherlock Holmes for non Sherlockians and Sherlockians alike, it is because it goes beyond the classic investigation. While in other adventures of Sherlock Holmes there are villains, scoundrels, or unfortunate accidents, in The Hound of the Baskervilles there is a monster, which gives a fantastic dimension to the story. 
The illustrations of Sidney Paget froze the demoniac animal running in the night thus revealing its incredible strength and eerily ominous glow despite the limitations of black ink of The Strand Magazine. 

This pencil case re-creates the famous art of Sidney Paget in vibrant colors. It is gorgeous, sturdy, practical, in one word the best gift for fans of the Sherlock Holmes canon who prefer pencils to keyboards.

# 4 Mug of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in the train by Sidney Paget

One of the most important aspects of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that contributed to their worldwide fame is the deep and true friendship between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Sidney Paget has beautifully captured its essence in many of his illustrations and particularly the one in which Sherlock Holmes is sitting in the train, facing Watson, and talking about the case at hand - the Adventure of Silver Blaze.

I love this amazingly colorful mug. It is a beautiful tribute to the original art of Sidney Paget. You can literally see the light shimmer through the windows of the train and dance on Sherlock's coat. Sherlock's piercing eyes and enthusiastic mannerisms shine and balance Watson's more stoic ways.

# 5 T-shirts of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes

These T-shirts will bring joy to fans of the Sherlock Holmes canon. Each of them is printed with nine illustrations related to the original stories. Sherlockians will enjoy showing off their favorite adventures such as Scandal in Bohemia, Silver Blaze, The Solitary Cyclist, The Speckled Bands, The Blue Carbuncle, and more.

There is a large choice of T-shirt styles. If you are not set up on a specific type, such baseball T-shirts, I would advise to narrow it down in the following mannner.

By size: if you need to purchase a 4 XL or 5 XL, look into classic T-shirts.

By price: essential T-shirts are budget-friendly while still looking and feeling great.

Premium: premium T-shirts are worth their price. The illustrations are printed on a very large area and the fabric feels very high quality.

# Bonus

## Reichenbach Falls: there will be tears

Sidney Paget has created an iconic illustration of the fight between Professor Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes at Reichenbach Falls. You cannot make more Sherlock Holmes canon than this specific artwork. The Sherlockians with whom I have discussed it said that their heart breaks when they think about it, because of the struggle and courage of Sherlock Holmes while facing the incarnation of evil, because of how he protected Dr. Watson, because of his demise, and because of  Watson's utter despair and sorrow. But his sacrifice turned him into so much more than a mere character, figment of one's imagination, it gave him the same reality that gods are made of which compelled Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to bring him back - the hero not only triumphed over evil but also over his own creator. Fans do not merely love Sherlock Holmes - they believe in him.

## Comforter The Dancing Men: pricey but stunning

In The Adventure of the Dancing Men, Sherlock Holmes must solve a case involving a very mysterious code made of dancing stick figures. This gorgeous comforter is the perfect gift for a fan of Sherlock Holmes who love this specific story and code-breaking.

It looks so cosy and warm. I love how the Dancing Men stand out so vividly. It would bring a sense of Sherlockian aesthetic to any bedroom quite effortlessly. It is a bit pricey but it would make a great anniversary gift.

I hope that this short review will help you pick the best gifts for fans of the Sherlock Holmes canon and particularly those who appreciate the art of Sidney Paget.
