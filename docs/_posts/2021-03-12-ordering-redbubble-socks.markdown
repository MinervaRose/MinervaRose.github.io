# *We ordered some socks so that you know what to expect.*

Last January, we started uploading our designs of everything literary and particularly Sherlockian on Redbubble. The way Redbubble works is the following, designers:
* upload a design made according to the Redbubble specifications and templates
* fill in title, tags, description, and whether it belongs to a collection or not
* choose on which product the design is made available

Then a series of images of the design is generated on the chosen products. It is these images that are visible on Redbubble shops, which means that **these images are not the real manufactured products but only visual simulations.**

It is very important to keep in mind that no matter how beautiful, comfortable, and high quality the socks are, they remain socks that is to say **woven fabric** onto which illustrations are printed.

Redbubble uses 360 Degree Sock Printing as stated in [this article](https://blog.redbubble.com/2019/09/say-hello-to-new-socks-and-comforters/). Socks are stretched around a cylinder while the machine prints the designs from digital files (as we understand it). Thanks to this technology, socks are seamless, the ink is absorbed into the fabric, and there are no white lines when the socks are stretched. 

Since the printing process happens on woven fabric and not for instance on a piece of paper, a "slight fuzziness" is to be expected and the designs might not come out as crispy clear as on the simulated images but they are still very much amazing.


### The case of the fantastic Edgar Allan Poe socks

Let's take the example of our [Edgar Allan Poe The Raven design](https://www.redbubble.com/i/socks/Edgar-Allan-Poe-Raven-by-VioletAndOberon/70129308.9HZ1B).

The images generated by Redbubble are literally stunning - no pun intended. The portrait of Edgar Allan Poe that we created really pops on the vibrant purple background. The raven pattern is very clear and sharply contrasts with the background.

The socks we received, while not exactly identical to the simulated images still look extremely close to the original design. The colors are amazing in daylight, the portrait is still very clear and recognizable, the ravens still stand out very dramatically.

*The socks arrived with a tag held by a tiny piece of plastic*

*Modelling on the leg of yours truly*

As can be seen above, they perfectly fit a size 9. They are so very comfortable. The top does not squeeze the calf but still stays high. They are the right amount of stretch. The sole has extra cushioning, and so do the toe and heel.


We are really very pleased with how this specific design was printed on the socks we purchased from Redbubble. We really believe that they can make great gifts for anybody who loves Edgar Allan Poe's works. I personally will wear them as much as I can. 


We hope that this blog post was informative and helped you to know what to expect when ordering socks on Redbubble and particularly from our [Violet And Oberon shop.](https://www.redbubble.com/people/VioletAndOberon/shop)
