# *We are so excited by our new Joseph Bologne T-shirts*


We have been adding some [Joseph Bologne designs to on our Redbubble store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/VioletAndOberon/shop?ref=account-nav-dropdown) and our recently opened [Teepublic store](https://www.teepublic.com/user/violetandoberon) and we can't wait to order some T-shirts and mugs for ourselves.


## Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, first classical composer of African ancestry


As mentioned in [this previous blog post](https://www.violetandoberon.com/redbubble/2021/03/05/honest-review-bologne-graphict.html), I am in love with his music. 
 
 
**Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges**, was a [composer](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chevalier_de_Saint-Georges), son of a slave and a French plantation owner. He rose to the heights of French society.


Tes Grands Auteurs En Petits Morceaux, French educational YouTuber, made a short educational [Youtube video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi8s8j1wIX0AhUNac0KHd-PD6wQtwJ6BAgGEAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DP4eKVZPXsac&usg=AOvVaw1wdx_byv5Yk_LDwIf_QKrv) to introduce the life of the French prodigy. Feel free to turn on the subtitles in the language of your choice.


*We could not find any Joseph Bologne T-shirts so we made our own!* 


I have always been a classical composer fan girl. Eons ago, I attended Music school. The teenager that I was back then would have loved to sport T-shirts and hoodies featuring my favorite composers. At the time there were none available where I was living. To be fair, there were some fancy T-shirts but just not the ones I was looking for. 


I was so excited when I realised I could create my own designs on Redbubble to finally get the T-shirts I had been dreaming of. Here are some of the Chevalier de Saint-Georges designs that we created.
