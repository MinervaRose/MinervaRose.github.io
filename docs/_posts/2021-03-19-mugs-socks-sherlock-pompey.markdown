At Violet and Oberon, we love re-creating the canonical illustrations for Sherlock Holmes by revisiting the beautiful artworks published along the original stories and redrawing and colorizing them.

Reflecting back on our first designs on socks and mugs, we thought it would be great to write a quick blog post to share how they compare.

### Sherlock Holmes and Pompey on socks and mugs, a case of slight colour variation.

One of our Sherlockian designs consists in Sherlock Holmes walking with Pompey on a leash, as originally created by American ilustrator Frederic Dorr Steele for *The adventure of the missing three-quarter.*

Our design places the two characters in an oval cameo. It lies on a background made of a repeat pattern of a dark brown vintage rugby ball on a light brown beige background.

The **simulated images** of the [mug](https://www.redbubble.com/i/mug/Sherlock-Holmes-and-Pompey-from-The-Missing-Three-Quarter-by-VioletAndOberon/71521436.9Q0AD) and [socks](https://www.redbubble.com/i/socks/Sherlock-Holmes-Missing-Three-Quarter-Dog-Rugby-Socks-by-VioletAndOberon/73438714.9HZ1B) on Redbubble are truly beautiful, and the products we received are of the best quality.


Upon checking the mugs and socks in broad daylight, we noticed a slight colour variation *even though it was the same colour in our files*. While the socks background are definitely beige brown, the mug background is way more of an old mustardy brown - which is great, both products are very beautiful.

As the Redbubble team states in their blog ["Color profiles are a really tricky topic"](https://help.redbubble.com/hc/en-us/articles/202270679-Dimensions-Format#color). Furthermore mugs and socks are printed in very different ways.

We really love how the ceramic mug shines in the light. It is absolutely gorgeous.

The socks have a real nice stretch to them, and the design, while slightly fuzzy - more about this in this [honest review](https://www.violetandoberon.com/redbubble/socks/2021/03/12/ordering-redbubble-socks.html), looks really clear. We have however decided to create a new version of the socks without the shadow under Pompey's belly in order to improve the legibility of the artwork on the socks specifically.

We hope that this blog post was informative and helped you to know what to expect in terms of colour variations across the products of [our Redbubble shop.](https://www.redbubble.com/people/VioletAndOberon/shop)
