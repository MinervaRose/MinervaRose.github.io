Pattern designed by VioletAndOberon

# Introduction

I have always been somewhat of a space nerd. For my 10th Christmas, I was gifted a telescope and an astronomy book. Lookin up has remained one of my favourite hobbies ever since. I usually never miss any [Nuit des étoiles](https://www.afastronomie.fr/les-nuits-des-etoiles). In summer, I put on a big cardigan and bring my telescope on the terrace in the middle of the night to look at the [Perseids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids) meteor showers. In winter, I love listening to [Star Talks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=star+talks), Neil de Grasse Tyson and Chuck Nice have such a fun way to share knowledge about the universe.   

As I am getting more into creating crochet wearable, I thought I should make a cardigan that shows my passion for space.

For the first blog article about this project, I have decided to share the pattern of the rocket spaceship appliqué that I have just designed.

# Make it look extra awesome

With grey glitter yarn. Fun fact, the yarn I used was from a store-bought child sweater that I frogged.

Start at the bottom centre of the rocket. Surface crochet on the right side of the work with slip stitches all along the edges and between color changes.

R2 repeat 5 times: Ch3, SS into 2nd ch, SC into 1st ch. SS into next SC.

Keep enough tail to sew it onto your favorite granny square or other crochet item.


# That's it!

You are now the proud maker of a really fun and sweet rocket crochet appliqué. Give yourself a tap on the back. If you crochet at the same speed as me, it probably took you an hour. Remember to stretch your hands, they have worked really hard.
