I have loved Deadpool ever since I watched the first movie. It made sense that my first pattern of an *almost standing on its own if there is no wind* amigurumi was dedicated to my favorite super hero.

It is about 21 cm high. It is almost entirely made of Red Heart acrylic yarn, except for the eyes that are scrap fabric that I cut and sewed on the head.
