I have loved Deadpool ever since I watched the first movie. It made sense that my first pattern of an *almost standing on its own if there is no wind* amigurumi was dedicated to my favorite super hero.

It is about 21 cm high. It is almost entirely made of acrylic yarn, except for the eyes that are scrap fabric that I cut and sewed on the head. 

# Cute Deadpool amigurumi crochet pattern

## Boots and legs

You are going to start with making the soles of the boots. You will be doing oval crocheting: start with a chain, and crochet all around the chain. 

Use 2.5 mm hook

Start with black yarn

Ch 6.

R1 sc in next 4 st, 3 sc in next st, sc in next 3 st, 2 sc in next st (12)

R2 2 sc next st, sc in next 3 st, 2 sc in next st, sc in next st, 2 sc in next st, sc in next 3 st, 2 sc in next st, sc in next st (16)

Stuff the boots and legs. 

## Body

You are going to start the body from the legs. You will be crocheting the legs together and creating the bottom of the crotch. Then you will work your way upward.

Before you start, make sure that both boots are facing front!

R1 ss black yarn in the first leg where you will be creating the crotch to bridge the two legs. ch 2. 10 sc along the leg, 2 sc along the chain 10 sc along the other leg, 2sc along the chain. (24)

R6 change to red yarn. sc-BLO all around

R7 (sc in next 4 st, sc2tog) * 4 (20)

Place a stitch marker, and put aside. You will be making the arms and then come back to the body to attach them.

## Arms

Start with red yarn.

R12-13 change to red. sc in each st (8)

In the next step, you will be crocheting the arms and body together.

Do not stuff the arms too much, particularly towards the top, because you might end up with the arms stuck in an awkward stiff position, perpendicular to the body.

## Head

You will start with making the little pointy part on top of the head. You will then be doing a normal crochet in the round ball shape. To finish, in order to make sure that there is a slight tilt you will be adding rows only on the front of the head, and then crochet all around again.

#### The little point on top of the head

You will be making a small rectangle. 

With red yarn

ch 4

R1-4 sc in next 3 st. ch 1, turn.

At the end of R4 you will do 4 sc along the top edge. You may have to do 2 sc at a time.

Fold the rectangle along the longest part, ss to join, ch 1.

Now you will be starting the head and crocheting in the round.

R1 In same st as the ch you've just made, 2 sc in next st, then sc in next st, then 2sc in next st, then sc. You should have 6 st.
