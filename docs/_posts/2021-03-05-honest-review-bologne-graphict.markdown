# *An honest review of the Joseph Bologne graphic t-shirt from the VioletAndOberon Redbubble store.*


Have you looked at all the gorgeous [graphic t-shirts available on our Redbubble store](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/?iaCode=u-tees&query=violetandoberon&sortOrder=recent&style=m-tee-panel-slim-crew) and wondered how the actual printed t-shirt that you will order compares to those mock-ups?

I had only purchased a beautiful graphic tank top from Hot Topic in the past, and I was honestly curious to see if Print on demand was creating products as vibrant as those you see in brick and mortar stores.

## Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, the Black Mozart

Classical music has always been a part of my life. I started playing musical intruments before I could even read. The first concert I attended was the Symphony No.40 in G minor, K.550 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It took place in a Cathedral. I still remember how overwhelmed I felt, how the music took over the child that I was. I have been cherishing Mozart ever since.

Later on I was gifted books about Music History and read a line, above the Mozart entry, that stated, ***"Joseph Boulogne: Symphonies concertantes"***, not much really. But my curiosity was piqued. I was about eleven at the time, and this one line about a composer that I had never heard of felt like a Famous Five mystery. I remember asking my music theory teacher about him, and he said he did not know him. The next time I went to the music sheet store, I inquired, and the same answer was given to me. 

I filed that strange case in my brain attic. 

**30 years later, the mystery was solved!** I was reading the [Classic FM newsletter](https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/periods-genres/film-tv/black-mozart-biopic-chevalier-de-saint-georges/), and saw his name again, and came to learn it was misspelled. *It's not Boulogne, it's Bologne.*

I then listened to his music and I was shocked. It had a lot of Mozart's flair, but it dated from before Mozart!

**Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges**, was the [Black Mozart](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chevalier_de_Saint-Georges), a champion fencer, 18th-century amazing French prodigy.

Our friends at Grands Auteurs made a short educational [Youtube video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi8s8j1wIX0AhUNac0KHd-PD6wQtwJ6BAgGEAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DP4eKVZPXsac&usg=AOvVaw1wdx_byv5Yk_LDwIf_QKrv) that you might wish to watch to learn more about his life.

His music is deeply enthralling. I listen to his masterpieces almost every day. I am particularly fond of [this recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqdmuSC1OLw).

*This was quite some background information, but I really had to share my excitement!* Once VioletAndOberon had designed the Joseph Bologne graphic t-shirt, it had to be the first I would get.


## The Joseph Bologne graphic t-shirt

As you can see on the images above, the graphic t-shirt simulated images from Redbubble look really beautiful. 

VioletAndOberon chose the portrait by Mather Brown as the main reference for creating the design. Then created [9 different color palettes graphic t-shirts](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/?iaCode=u-tees&query=violetandoberon%20joseph%20bologne&sortOrder=relevant&style=m-tee-panel-slim-crew) for every occasion and oufits

As stated on Redbubble Graphic t-shirts are printed with the *Sublimation transfer technique prints*. It allows for crisp, vivid colors and Edge-to-edge front print. Graphic t-shirts feel very soft. The front panel that gets printed is 96% polyester/4% spandex. The back panel, sleeves and neck bind are 100% cotton, and customers can choose either black or white.

I ordered [the one that preserved the original classical color scheme](https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Joseph-Bologne-Chevalier-de-Saint-Georges-classical-portrait-by-VioletAndOberon/82480758.1YYVU).

When I opened the nicely sealed Redbubble parcel, I got so amazed. Even wrapped, the portrait was so vivid, it was like Joseph Bologne was looking at me. 

Here it is, on a hanger.

The image is printed in such a crip way on the fabric. I can't state enough how delighted I am. 

VioletAndOberon even featured it on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/violetandoberon/).
