A few weeks ago, Violet posted the picture of the little Sherlock Holmes and his tiny violin and bow that she crocheted on Instagram. We were overwhelmed by the amount of very kind messages that we received and we listened to your suggestion of creating a Basil Rathbone amigurumi. 

We thought the simplest way to do so, particularly since some of our followers were already working on the wonderful pattern created by [Vilonal on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/crocheted-consulting-detective), was to adapt it to go from Benedict Cumberbatch to Basil Rathbone. 

# Hair

While you should follow the entire instructions for crocheting the head, torso, arms, and legs, you will have to change the hair. 

Your goal is to stitch strands of brown yarn in a sleek manner. I advise that you start with the hairline on the top of the forehead and going a bit towards the back as you reach the temples, then the sides in front of the ears. Finish with the hair at the back of the head.

# Detective outfit: Inverness coat and deerstalker hat

We thought that Basil Rathbone had to wear quintessential Sherlockian clothes, the Inverness coat and deerstalker hat. 

Violet put together the following patterns.

## How to crochet the Inverness coat for your Sherlock Holmes amigurumi 

### Main part of the coat

ch 25

R1 skip first ch from the hook. sc in the next 24 stitches. Ch1 turn.

R2-8 skip first ch from the hook. hdc in the next 24 stitches. Ch1 turn.

R9 hdc in the next 3 stitches. Ch1 turn.

R10-11 sc in the next 3 stitches.

R 12 miss the first stitch. sc in the next 2 stitches. Ch1 turn.

R13 sc in the 2 stitches.

Fasten off and weave in the ends.


### Top left and right  corners to create armholes

Starting from the top corner on the other side, reproduce R9 to R13 like so:

R9 hdc in the next 3 stitches. Ch1 turn.

R10-11 sc in the next 3 stitches.

R 12 miss the first stitch. sc in the next 2 stitches. Ch1 turn.

R13 sc in the 2 stitches.

Fasten off and weave in the ends.


### Top centre to create armholes

Now you will work the central part of the back of the coat. Skip the first 7 stitches from R9 (three stitches are already worked and four are not already worked).

R1 insert hook, ss and ch1. Starting from the same stitch, sc 10.

R2 sc2tog, sc in the next 6 st, sc2tog, ch 1, turn.

R3 sc2tog, sc in the next 4 st, sc2tog, ch 1, turn.

R4 sc2tog, sc in the next 2 st, sc2tog.

Finish off and weave in the ends.

### Sleeves

Make two.

ch 12. ss to join.

R1-3 sc in each stitch around.

R4-7 hdc in each stitch around.

R8 sc in each st around, ch 1, turn,

R9 sc in the next 8 st, ch 1, turn.

R10 sc2tog, sc in the next 4 st, sc2tog, ch 1, turn.

R11 sc2tog, sc in the next 2 st, sc2tog, ch 1, turn.

R12 sc in the 4 stitches.

Fasten off. Use tail to sleeve onto the armhole.


### Left, top, and right edge ridge

To create the edge ridge, slip stitch all along starting from the bottom right corner, continuing onto the top, down to the bottom left corner.

Do no slip stitch along the bottom of the coat.

### Lapels

R1 sc all along.

In order for the lapels to look like they are folded as a mirror image, you will do R2 in the BLO for the left lapel, and FLO for the right lapel. You  are more than welcome to proceed differently. 

Crochet is all about creativity.

R2 starting from the sc at the top of the coat. 2 dc in the first stitch, triple in the next stitch, ch 3, ss in next stitch, ss in next stitch, ch 3, triple in next stitch, dc in next 2 stitches, hdc in the remaining stitches.

### Capelet

ch 15

R1 ch 2. 15 dc. ch2 turn.

When there is not enough stitches for the full repeat sequence, simply dc in remaining stitches.

R2 dc in first stitch, dc-increase in second stitch. Repeat.

R3 dc in first and second stitches, dc-increase in third stitch. Repeat.

R4 triple in first, second, and third stitches, three triple in fourth stitch. Repeat.

Fasten off.

Sew along the slip stitch at the top of the coat.


### Pockets

Make two.

Ch 5.

R1-3 skip first ch from the hook. Sc in the next four stitches, ch 1, turn.

Sew pockets on coat.

## Deerstalker hat

### Main part

Ch2.

R1 Sc 6 in first chain.

R2-4 ss to join. ch 2. 2 dc in each stitch. 

R5 ss to join, ch 3. triple in each stitch all around.

Fasten off.


### Front and back bills

Fold the hat flat. The bills are each crocheted directly on the hat along 9 stitches (if you are a beginner, you may find easier to crochet them separately and then sew them on).


R1 ss. ch 1. sc in same stitch as chain, then sc in the next eight stitches (if crocheting separately from the hat, ch10, then sc 9).

R2-3 ch 1, turn. sc in each stitch.

R4 ch1, turn, sc2tog, sc in next 5 stitches, sc2tog.

R5 ch1, turn, sc2tog, sc in next 3 stitches, sc2tog.

Optional slip stitch all along each bill.


### Side flaps


The side flaps are each crocheted along 6 stitches. Since we want the flaps to fold upwards, we will crochet BLO.

R1 ss. ch 1. sc in same stitch as chain, then sc BLO in the next 6 stitches.

R2-4 ch 1, turn, sc BLO in the next 6 stitches.

R5 ch3, skip first stitch, triple in next 5 stitches.

R6 ch1, turn, sc2tog, sc, sc2tog.

Fasten off.

Sew the flaps so that they stay upwards. Then you might wish to sew a little bow knot between them.
