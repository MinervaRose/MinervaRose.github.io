# Introduction

### About Joseph Bologne Chevalier de Saint-Georges

Joseph Bologne (1745-1799) was a champion fencer and a virtuoso violinist and conductor. **He is the first classical composer of African ancestry.** His music and talent were so prodigious that he took Paris by storm. Even though his father was a mere planter in the French colony of Guadeloupe and his mother was a slave, Chevalier de Saint-Georges reached the highest levels of the society of the time. He even became close to Queen Marie-Antoinette and to the Prince of Wales.

If you have been following me for a little while, you know that I have a profound love for his music. 

Chevalier de Saint-Georges had to be the first amigurumi of composers that I would design. 

It took me a bit of thinking, as I wanted him to look somewhat childlike, endearing, and cute. I first came up with the illustration above, then I aimed at creating it in crochet.

# Pattern information

## Basic information

Terminology: USA

Size: 26 cm tall doll, 13 cm long violin

Difficulty: Beginner to Elementary

Yarn weight: Medium 4 acrylic, Between Light 3 and Medium 4 acrylic and metallic, Light 3 acrylic


## Supplies

* 2.5 mm hook (for almost all the pieces)

* 2 mm hook (for the lacy pieces)

* Toy stuffing. I used pillow stuffing.

* Yarn sewing needle

* Short and long pins. Feel free to use only standard pins.

* Scissors

* Stitch markers

* 1 set of safety eyes

The pattern contains the instructions to crochet:

* 1 doll of Joseph Bologne with his wig on

* 1 jacket

* 1 jabot and cuffs

* 1 violin proportionate to the doll

Depending on what you prefer, you may choose to crochet all the pieces, or to leave some of them out. The doll will look good even without the jacket, jabot and cuffs!

I designed this doll of Joseph Bologne using mostly Bernat Premium and Red Heart Super Saver yarn. I purchase them all at my local Walmart. This is not sponsored. I however suggest you use equivalent yarn in order to achieve similar results.

You may feel like using cotton yarn instead of acrylic for a non fuzzy effect, as often recommended for amigurumi. Rest assured that using acrylic will still give great results!

## Yarn used by VioletAndOberon when designing

Colour of the yarn, yarn used, what piece was made with it

White - Bernat Premium white - Wig, torso, arms, socks

White- Luv Baby Easy Knit Yarn 3 Light - Jabot, cuffs, violin strings

Brown - Red Heart Super Saver - Face, hands

Grey - Soft Gray Sparkle Bernat Premium - Trousers, detail on shoes and belt buckle

Black - Bernat Premium black - Belt, shoes, violin pieces

Pastel - Blue Blue [Red Heart Roll with it Sparkle " Cristal"](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/red-heart-roll-with-it-sparkle-yarn-acrylic-4-medium-53oz150g-561-yards-amethyst/6000199609419)  - Jacket

Pastel orange - Orange [Red Heart Roll with it Sparkle "Magic"](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/red-heart-roll-with-it-sparkle-yarn-acrylic-4-medium-53oz150g-561-yards-amethyst/6000199609419) - Waistcoat flaps

Orange - Bernat Premium - Violin

Yellow - Bernat Premium - Small violin piece


Please note that Bernat Premium is like the Super Value but using Premium grade acrylic. It is very soft. I highly recommend it.

## Necessary skills

* Working in rows and in the round (in a spiral)

* Accurately counting stitches and rows

* Recognizing the different loops on a stitch

* Basic crochet stitches

* Shell stitch - The Shell stitch will be thoroughly explained to make it accessible to beginners

* Basic sewing
 


## Abbreviations and their translations (work in progress, I hope it helps) English/ French/ Spanish/ German

Skip: Skip/ passer/ saltar/ überspringen

Rem: remaining

FLO: front loop only/ travail uniquement dans le brin avant/ sólo parte delantera de la cadeneta/ nur vorderes Maschenglied

BLO: back loop only/ travail uniquement dans le brin arrière / sólo parte trasera de la cadeneta/ 	nur hinteres Maschenglied

The front loop is always the one closest to you. When you turn your working piece, the front loop becomes the back loop, and so forth.

## Tension

You will need to keep the same tension throughout the project in order for each piece to fit together.

Do not pull on the yarn after each stitch in an attempt at making your work tighter because it is an amigurumi crochet pattern - if you are using a 2.5 mm hook, it will get tight with your usual tension!

## How to use the stitch markers

Stitch markers are there to help you count rows, rounds, identify the first stitch, etc.

Feel free to attribute a color system to your stitches to know what they are used for.

For example:

Green for the first stitch of a row.

Red for every 10, 20, or nth number of stitches.

Blue for identifying the right side from the wrong side.

## Stuffing

The pieces should be stuffed as you go. However, **be very careful not to overstuff.**

**Do not stuff the arms much if at all** or they will get stuck in a cross-like position.

Do not overstuff the rest of the piece as it might stretch the stitches, deform the doll and show the stuffing.

## Safety warning

This crochet creation is not suitable for babies and young children. It is not a toy. It has not been tested for safety.


# Head

Use a 2.5 mm hook.

Use brown yarn.

You will need 2 stitch markers. One that you will place at the first SC of each round. The other one that you will place when you reach R16 to be able to easily find where to put the safety eyes.

R1 *Place the stitch marker on the first SC as you crochet it*. 6 SC in MR. (6)

R2 (SC-inc) X6 (12)

R3 (1SC, SC-inc) X6 (18)

R4 (2SC, SC-inc) X6 (24)

R5 (3SC, SC-inc) X6 (30)

R6 (4SC, SC-inc) X6 (36)

R7 (5SC, SC-inc) X6 (42)

R8 (6SC, SC-inc) X6 (48)

R9-19 48SC

*Tip:*

*It’s easy to get confused or lost when you are working several rounds with the same amount of stitches multiple times.* 

*Keep a notebook or a piece of scrap paper to write the number of the round you are working on, and then tick it when you have completed it.* 

R20 (6SC, SC-dec) X6 (42)

R21 (5SC, SC-dec) X6 (36)

Place the eyes with a width of 6SC between them.

Start stuffing.

R22 (4SC, SC-dec) X6 (30)

R23 (3SC, SC-dec) X6 (24)

R24 (2SC, SC-dec) X6 (18)

R25 (1SC, SC-dec) X6 (12)

Finish stuffing.

SS. Tie off, leaving a 30 cm tail to later sew onto the body.


# Ears

R1 6SC in MR

Sew then 6SC apart from the eyes.

![Cute ears of Joseph Bologne amigurumi](/images/st-george-ears.JPG)

# Eyes

Sew some white on the exterior side of each eye.

# Upper cheeks

Sew some pink or light orange at a distance of 1SC below each eye.

# Nose

Sew some brown. Start at a distance of 2SC from the left eye then sew over 4SC. Then sew over the centre 2SC below the 4SC.


You can now set the head aside.

# Wig

The wig may look like a complex shape but it is actually quite simple. It starts with a circle, then it is extended in some places. It's quite nifty.

![The amigurumi wig flat](/images/st-george-wig.JPG)

You will need white yarn.

Use a 2.5 mm hook.

The main part of the wig is worked in the round, the rolls are worked in rows, the strands, and curls are worked by chaining and then slip stitching back to the beginning of the chain.

R1 *Place the stitch marker on the first SC as you crochet it*. 6 SC in MR. (6)

R2  (SC-inc) X6. (12)

R3 (1SC, SC-inc) X6 (18)

R4 (2SC, SC-inc) X6 (24)

R5 (3SC, SC-inc) X6 (30)

R6 (4SC, SC-inc) X6 (36)

R7 (5SC, SC-inc) X6 (42)

R8 (6SC, SC-inc) X6 (48)

R9-10 48SC

## First long fringe strand

R1 Ch20. Starting from the 3rd ch from your hook, 18DC. SS into the 3rd stitch of the main part of the wig.

## Other front strands

The other strands will be a bit lower on the forehead.

R11 SC15.

R12 Ch1, turn. SC15.

R13 This is the row from which you will start your strands.

SS, SS then first strand:

Ch16. Starting from the 3rd ch from your hook 14DC.SS into the main part of the wig.

Then second strand:

Ch11. Starting from the 2nd ch from your hook 10SC. SS into the main part of the wig.

Then third strand:

Ch15. Starting from the 2nd ch from your hook 14SC. SS into the main part of the wig.

Because we have just added R11, R12, and R13, you need to SS along the side of these rows to get back to the main part of the wig at R10.

## First side roll:

Count 18SC from your Stitch marker. This is where you should start the first side roll.

*The rolls start with a basis of 10SC, then more rows are added with increases to get an A-line shape.*

R11 10SC.

R12 Ch2, turn. (DC, DC-inc) X4, 2 DC. (14)

R13 Ch2, turn. (2DC, DC-inc) X4, 2DC. (17)

R14 Ch2, turn. (3DC, DC-inc) X4, 1DC. (19)

R15 Ch2, turn. (4DC, DC-inc) X3, 4DC. (21)

R16 Ch2, turn. (5DC, DC-inc) X3, 3DC. (24)

R17 Ch2, turn. 24DC

R18 Ch2, turn. 24DC

R19 Ch1, turn. 24SC

Ch1, tie off.

## Ponytail and curls

The back of the wig is made of a ponytail with curls.

R11 10SC.

R12 Ch2, turn, 10DC

R13 Ch2, turn, 10DC

R14 Ch2, turn, 10DC

Ch1, turn, SS.

Now you will create the curls. When I first designed the little Joseph Bologne doll, I made 6 curly strands. Feel free to make more or less by changing where you SS back into R14 at the end of your curly strands.

### Curls

Ch 22. Starting from the 3rd ch from your hook. (DC-incT) X10. 5DC, 5HDC.

If you wish you can make shorter or longer curls.

Tie off when you have reached the side of R14.

## Second side roll

You will proceed in the same manner as the first side roll.

R11 10SC.

R12 Ch2, turn. (DC, DC-inc) X4, 2 DC. (14)

R13 Ch2, turn. (2DC, DC-inc) X4, 2DC. (17)

R14 Ch2, turn. (3DC, DC-inc) X4, 1DC. (19)

R15 Ch2, turn. (4DC, DC-inc) X3, 4DC. (21)

R16 Ch2, turn. (5DC, DC-inc) X3, 3DC. (24)

R17 Ch2, turn. 24DC

R18 Ch2, turn. 24DC

R19 Ch1, turn. 24SC

Ch1, tie off.

It will be easier to install the wig once the head is attached to the body. Set aside.


# Arms

You will need brown and white yarn.

Use a 2.5 mm hook.

Start with brown.

Make two.

R1 *Place the stitch marker on the first SC as you crochet it*. 4SC in MR.

R2 (Sc-inc) X2. (8)

R3-4 8SC

R5 7SC, 1 Popcorn stitch made with 4DC

R6-7 8SC

Change to white yarn.

R8-14 8SC.

SS. Tie off, but keep a tail that might be used to sew the armpits if they are a bit too loose.

![Arms of the Joseph Bologne amigurumi](/images/st-george-arm.JPG)

Do not close the hole. We need the 8SC because we will crochet them with the torso later on.

Use a pencil to push a little bit of filling down to the hand. Put very little in the arm.

Set aside.
 

# Foot and leg

You will need black, grey, and white yarn.

Use a 2.5 mm hook.

Start with black.

*I am very fond of this technique to create little shoes, feet, or boots that are flat and help provide good support for the rest of the doll when you place it vertically.*

*You will be crocheting the sole of the shoe first which is made with an oval.*

Ch6. Start from the 2nd ch from your hook.

R1 4SC, SC-incT, 3SC, SC-inc (12)

R16 (BLO-SC, BLO-SC-dec) X5 (10)

R17 10SC (10)

Tie off. Do not close the hole at the top of the thigh of each leg because we will crochet the abdomen onto it.

Stuff firmly.

Make the shoe adornments before joining the legs together as it is easier.

![amigurumi foot and leg](/images/st-george-leg.JPG)

### Shoe adornment

You will need black yarn and grey yarn.

Use a 2 mm hook.

Insert the hook in R4 which is the last black yarn row before the white yarn row.
 
R1 SC all around. Tie off and cut.

R2 Identify the 4SC at the front of the shoe. Insert hook and SC in each of them.

R3 Ch1, turn, 4SC.

R4 Turn, SS, 2SC, SS. Then SS along the edge back to R1. Tie off. Cut.

Using a yarn needle and sew grey yarn to create a buckle.

By now you should have made the foot and legs, the hand and arms, and the head. If you have skipped some of these pieces, go back and crochet them now as you won't be able to crochet the body without them.

# Upper body

## Abdomen

Start with the grey yarn. 

**Make sure to place the legs with the feet facing the same direction.**
**Make sure that the heels are the parts the closest to you.**

You are going to start from the right leg.

Since we are making the crotch, make sure that you are starting from the inner part of the leg.

SS in the right leg.
 
R1 SC in the right leg. Ch2. SC in the left leg. SC3, SC-inc, SC5 along the left leg. SC2 along the chain. SC in the right leg. SC3, SC-inc, SC3. (28)

SS. Tie off.

![Amigurumi of Joseph Bologne making his belly](/images/st-george-abdomen.JPG)

Stuff the thighs and the abdomen quite firmly so that they don't go all limp when you will put the doll up. But do not overstuff. You need to take the arms now as you will be crocheting them to the torso.

## Torso

*Make sure that both arms are in the same direction*.

*Make sure that the thumbs are facing front.*

*Make sure that the doll is facing front.*

You are going to start from the front center of the belly. SS, Ch1, SC in same stitch. Place a stitch Marker.

R1 4SC along the belly. Ch1. 8SC along the left arm. SC in ch. 10SC along the back of the body. Ch1. 8SC along the right arm. SC in ch. 5SC along the belly. (40)

You should stuff since we are reaching the top of the torso and the hole of the neck will become too small to stuff later.

![Crochet the torso and shoulders in continuity to the belly](/images/st-george-torso.JPG)

R5 (SC, SC-dec) X8, SC in rem stitch (17)

R6 (2SC, SC-dec) X4, SC in rem stitch (13)

R7 5SC, SC-dec, 5SC (11)

R8 11SC

Do not stuff the neck too much.
In order for the head not to bobble, I find it best to put a piece of plastic of wood that acts like a spine from the body to the neck of the doll.

Tie off. Keep tail for sewing head.

![Body of Joseph Bologne amigurumi](/images/st-george-body-complete.JPG)


# Sewing the head

*(Pictures and explations to be added soon.)*

# Installing the wig

As mentioned earlier, it is much easier to install the wig once the head is securely sewed to the body.

## Placing it
You are going to start with pinning the wig, as it is, onto the head. Make sure that the centre of the wig matches the centre of the head. Place a long pin.

Place several pins around the crown of the head.  


## Rolling the side rolls up

Then proceed to roll up the side rolls. For the best results, roll them slightly diagonally so that the roll looks tight on the front and elongated at the back. 

You should be able to make the two rolls touch at the back below the pony tail. 

Place some pins all along.


## Shaping the pony tail

I recommend placing a little big of stuffing to give a bit of volume toward the end of the skull.

Position the curls by stacking their roots together and pin with a long pin.

## The strands on the forehead

Place and pin. Make sure to gently roll the tip of each strands. Use the picture for reference.

Once everything is positioned and pinned securely, sew on to the head.


![Pinning the hair of the Joseph Bologne amigurumi](/images/st-george-pinned-wig.JPG)

![Joseph Bologne amigurumi with his wig sewed on and his face embellished](/images/st-george-head-wig.JPG)


# Jabot and cuffs

*The jabot and cuffs are rectangles made with shell stitches. The only difference between the jabot and the cuff is the amount of rows.*

You will need the light 3 acrylic white yarn.

Use a 2mm hook.

## Cuffs

Make two.

R1 Ch23. Starting from the 2nd ch from your hook, (SC, skip 2, 5DC into the next st, skip 2) X3. SC, skip 2, 3DC in the last ch of the row.

R2-5  Ch1, turn. SC into the first DC stitch. 5DC into the next SC stitch. Skip 2. SC into the next DC stitch. 5DC into the next SC stitch. Skip 2 SC into the next DC stitch. 5DC into the next SC stitch. Skip 2 SC into the next DC. Skip 2, 3DC into the last SC.

![Pretty lacy cuffs of Joseph Bologne amigurumi](/images/st-george-cuff.JPG)

Sew the two sides of to make a tube.

Place onto the arms at R8 so that it matches the beginning of the white sleeve. Sew.
 

## Jabot

Use the same instructions of the cuffs but make 12 rows.

You need to sew the jabot onto a collar. Use the same yarn as the one for the jabot and the cuffs.

R1 Ch30, Starting from the 2nd ch from your hook 29SC.

R2 Ch1, turn HDC 29.

Place it around the neck of your little Joseph Bologne, and sew to join the two ends.

Sew the Jabot along the collar at the front.

![Jabot of Joseph Bologne](/images/st-george-jabot.JPG)

   
You should now feel comfortable with crocheting shell stitches.


If you wish, you can choose to stop here and not to crochet the coat of the Joseph Bologne amigurumi. He already looks quite dapper and dashing.

![Amigurumi of Joseph Bologne without his coat on](/images/st-george-almost.JPG)

# Coat

The main part of the coat is made of shell stitches. The collar is made of HDC stitches. The sleeves are made of DC stitches.

R1 Ch43. Starting from the 3rd ch from your hook, 41DC.

R2 Ch1, turn. (SC, skip 2, 5DC into the next st, skip 2) X6. Skip 2, SC, 3DC in the last st of the row.

![Bottom of the coat of Joseph Bologne amigurumi](/images/st-george-coat-bottom.JPG)

R3-R8 Proceed in the same manner R8 included.

Now you are going to work only on one side to create the first front part of the coat. Start with the **right**
.
R9-13 Ch1, turn. SC in the first st. 5DC in the SC. SC into the 3rd DC st of the shell. 3DC into the next SC.

Now to the other side to create the second front part of the coat.

R9 You need to crochet on the same side of the piece as you were when doing R9 on the other side of the coat, the **left**.

Count ten st from the end. SS, Ch1, SC in the same st. DC in the SC. SC into the 3rd DC st of the next shell. 3DC into the last st.

R10-13 Ch1, turn. SC in the first st. 5DC in the next SC. SC into the 3rd DC st of the next shell. 3DC into the next SC.
    
Now you are going to create the top of the centre back of the coat.

Put your crochet piece on the same side as you did for row 9.
R9 SS into the 3rd st of the first free shell. Ch1. SC in the same st. 5DC in the next SC. SC into the 3rd DC st of the next shell. 5DC in the next SC. SC into the 3rd DC st of the next shell. Skip 1. 3DC into the next st.

# Joseph Bologne's violin


You are going to crochet all the parts of the violin and then sew them together. It is quite a fun process.

![All the little parts of the amigurumi violin](/images/st-george-violin-parts.JPG)

## Violin plates

Make two.

*The violin top and back plates are each made by doing oval crochet.*

You will need orange yarn.
