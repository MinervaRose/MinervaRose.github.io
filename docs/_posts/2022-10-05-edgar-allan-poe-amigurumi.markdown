As far as I can remember, I have always loved Edgar Allan Poe. I am particularly fond of The Raven and The Conqueror Worm. Edgar Allan Poe had such a powerful way of expressing despair bordering on madness while pondering the human condition that it literally became inscribed in his face - his features showing profound sadness.

In this free crochet pattern, I tried to capture Edgar Allan Poe's emotions and his major physical characteristics so that he would not look too generic. He is Edgar, not just any crochet doll. I still aimed at retaining a lot of cuteness despite the tragic of his face. I also wanted to honour his poems and crocheted a tiny raven and a crowned worm. 

**Please note that this is a work in progress to be completed in October 2022**

This pattern is for private use only. If posting it on social media, kindly mention that it was originally designed by VioletAndOberon.

Do no slip stitch along the bottom of the coat.

In order for the lapels to look like they are folded as a mirror image, you will do R2 in the BLO for the left lapel, and FLO for the right lapel. You are more than welcome to proceed differently.
