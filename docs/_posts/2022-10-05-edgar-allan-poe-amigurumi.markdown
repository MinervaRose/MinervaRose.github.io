As far as I can remember, I have always loved Edgar Allan Poe. I am particularly fond of The Raven and The Conqueror Worm. Edgar Allan Poe had such a powerful way of expressing despair bordering on madness while pondering the human condition that it literally became inscribed in his face - his features showing profound sadness.

In this free crochet pattern, I tried to capture Edgar Allan Poe's emotions and his major physical characteristics so that he would not look too generic. He is Edgar, not just any crochet doll. I still aimed at retaining a lot of cuteness despite the tragic of his face. I also wanted to honour his poems and crocheted a tiny raven and a crowned worm.
